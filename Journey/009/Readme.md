## Cloud Research

### EC2 Overview
- It mainly consists in the capability of :
   -  Renting virtual machines (EC2)
   -  Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
   -  Distributing load across machines (ELB)
   -  Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)

### SSH 
- SSH or Secure Shell is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network.  It allows you to control a
remote machine, all using the command line.

- Can SSH using:
  - OpenSSH ~/.ssh/config (...Linux/ Mac OS X)
  - Putty       (... Windows)
  - EC2 Instance Connect (..from within the browser)

### EC2 Instance Connect
- Connects to your EC2 instance within your browser
- No need to use your key file that was downloaded
- A temporary key is uploaded onto EC2 by AWS
- Works only **out-of-the-box with `Amazon Linux 2`**
- Need to make sure the **port 22 is still opened**


### Tpes of IPs: 
- Public IPs
