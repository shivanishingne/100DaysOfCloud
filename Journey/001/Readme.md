# [Day 1/100] : Getting Started & Research about pre-signed URLs

## Cloud Research

- Today I started out with making my own repo for the challenge :)
- Wanted to know how to access objects in the S3 bucket from my website, but apparently we need to do that in a secure way.
- Did some research about pre-signed URLs, which can generate a temporary URL with a timeout, using which a person (without IAM policies) can access the objects in the Bucket securely.
