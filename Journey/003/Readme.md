# [Day 3/100] : Developing on AWS : Setting up CLI


## Cloud Research


- Developing against AWS has two components:
    - How to perform interactions with AWS without using the Online Console?
    - How to interact with AWS Proprietary services? (S3, DynamoDB, etcâ€¦)

Using AWS CLI we can develop and perform aws tasks against aws programmatically.


### Installing the AWS CLI

- AWS CLI needs Python 2 version 2.6.5+ or Python 3 version 3.3+ and Pip.

- using Pip you can install the AWS CLI (on Linux, macOS, or Unix) by running:
  
> ` $ sudo pip install awscli`

### Add Your Access Key to AWS CLI

- We now need to tell the AWS CLI to use your Access Keys
- Run  `aws configure` with your secret key id and access key.

- You can leave the Default region name and Default output format the way they are.
