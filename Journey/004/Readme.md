# [Day 4/100] : Setting up Serverless framework


## Cloud Research

- The Serverless Framework enables developers to deploy backend applications as independent functions that will be deployed to AWS Lambda.
- It also configures AWS Lambda to run your code in response to HTTP requests using Amazon API Gateway.

### Installing the framework

- Install serverless globally (needs npm)
  > `npm install serverless -g`

### Beginning of the Notes-api project: "Scratch"

- Began documenting the project specific details in this [Github repo](https://github.com/shivanishingne/serverless-stack-api).
